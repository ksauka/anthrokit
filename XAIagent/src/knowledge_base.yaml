dataset_overview: |
  **Adult Census Income Dataset**
  
  The Adult Census Income Dataset is a benchmark dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository 
  containing 32,561 records with 15 attributes. Each record represents a person's social, employment, 
  and demographic information from the U.S. Census database from 1994.
  
  **Prediction Task**: Determine whether an individual makes more than $50,000 per year based on their attributes.
  
  **Target Variable**: Income with two classes:
  - ≤50K: Income less than or equal to $50,000
  - >50K: Income greater than $50,000
  
  **Model Performance**: Our trained RandomForest classifier achieves 85.94% accuracy on this dataset.

features:
  age:
    description: "Your age in years. This is a numerical value representing how old you are."
    why_important: "Age is one of the strongest predictors of income. Generally, income tends to increase with age as people gain experience, advance in their careers, and take on more responsibility. The model has learned that people in their 40s-50s typically earn more than younger workers."
    typical_values: "17-90 years. Most working adults are between 25-65."
    model_behavior: "Higher age generally increases approval probability, especially ages 35-55."
  
  workclass:
    description: "The type of employment you have - whether you work in the private sector, are self-employed, work for the government, or other work arrangements."
    why_important: "Your employment type indicates income stability and earning potential. Private sector and government jobs often provide stable income, while self-employment can vary. The model considers this when assessing financial reliability."
    typical_values: "Private (most common), Self-employed (incorporated or not), Federal/Local/State government, Without-pay, Never-worked"
    model_behavior: "Private and government workers typically have higher approval rates than self-employed or unemployed."
  
  education:
    description: "Your highest level of education completed - from preschool through doctorate degree."
    why_important: "Education level is strongly correlated with earning potential. Higher education typically leads to higher-paying jobs and career opportunities. The model has learned that Bachelor's degrees, Master's degrees, and Doctorates are strong predictors of higher income."
    typical_values: "Preschool, Elementary (1st-8th), High School (9th-12th, HS-grad), Some-college, Associate degrees, Bachelors, Masters, Doctorate, Professional school"
    model_behavior: "Bachelor's degree or higher dramatically increases approval probability. HS-grad is neutral baseline."
  
  education_num:
    description: "A numerical representation of your education level, where higher numbers mean more education (1=Preschool, 16=Doctorate)."
    why_important: "This is a numerical encoding of your education level used by the model to understand the relationship between education and income. It captures the progression from less to more education."
    typical_values: "1-16, where 9=HS-grad, 13=Bachelors, 14=Masters, 16=Doctorate"
    model_behavior: "Each increase in education level improves predicted income probability."
  
  marital_status:
    description: "Your current marital situation - whether you're married, divorced, single, separated, widowed, etc."
    why_important: "Marital status can reflect household financial stability and earning patterns. Married individuals often have dual-income households or shared expenses, which affects financial capacity. The model considers this as part of overall financial profile."
    typical_values: "Married-civ-spouse (most predictive of higher income), Divorced, Never-married, Separated, Widowed, Married-spouse-absent, Married-AF-spouse"
    model_behavior: "Married-civ-spouse significantly increases approval probability; Never-married and Divorced have lower rates."
  
  occupation:
    description: "Your type of work or job category - the field you work in professionally."
    why_important: "Different occupations have vastly different income levels. Professional specialty workers (doctors, lawyers, engineers) and executives typically earn more than service workers or laborers. Your occupation is one of the strongest predictors the model uses."
    typical_values: "Prof-specialty, Exec-managerial, Tech-support, Sales, Craft-repair, Adm-clerical, Machine-op-inspct, Other-service, Handlers-cleaners, Farming-fishing, Transport-moving, Protective-serv, Priv-house-serv, Armed-Forces"
    model_behavior: "Prof-specialty and Exec-managerial strongly increase approval; Other-service and Handlers-cleaners decrease it."
  
  relationship:
    description: "Your role within your family structure - whether you're a husband, wife, child, etc."
    why_important: "This captures household dynamics and typically correlates with age and financial responsibility. Husbands and wives (in traditional nuclear families) tend to have higher household incomes than single individuals or dependent children."
    typical_values: "Husband, Wife, Not-in-family, Own-child, Unmarried, Other-relative"
    model_behavior: "Husband and Wife roles increase approval probability; Own-child and Unmarried decrease it."
  
  race:
    description: "Your ethnic background or racial identity."
    why_important: "The model includes race as it was present in the original census data. However, this reflects historical patterns of income inequality and should not be used as a decision factor in real-world lending. We include it for research transparency but acknowledge its ethical concerns."
    typical_values: "White, Black, Asian-Pac-Islander, Amer-Indian-Eskimo, Other"
    model_behavior: "This feature's impact reflects historical income inequality patterns in the 1994 census data."
  
  sex:
    description: "Your gender identity - Male or Female."
    why_important: "The model includes gender as it was in the census data. Like race, this reflects historical patterns including the gender pay gap. This should not be used as a decision factor in real-world lending, and we include it only for research transparency."
    typical_values: "Male, Female"
    model_behavior: "This feature's impact reflects the gender pay gap present in 1994 census data."
  
  capital_gain:
    description: "Income from investments, such as stock market gains, property sales, or other capital assets. Measured in dollars."
    why_important: "Capital gains indicate additional wealth beyond regular employment income. People with significant capital gains typically have higher total income and greater financial resources. Even small amounts signal some level of investment activity."
    typical_values: "0 (most common) to 99,999. Any value above 0 indicates investment income."
    model_behavior: "Any capital gain >0 significantly increases approval probability. Values >5000 are very strong positive indicators."
  
  capital_loss:
    description: "Losses from investments, such as stock market losses or property losses. Measured in dollars."
    why_important: "While losses reduce income, the presence of capital loss indicates investment activity and suggests someone with financial assets to invest. Paradoxically, small losses can indicate wealth (you need money to invest to have losses)."
    typical_values: "0 (most common) to 4,356. Values 1800-2000 are moderately common among investors."
    model_behavior: "Small losses (indicating investment activity) may slightly increase approval; large losses may decrease it."
  
  hours_per_week:
    description: "The typical number of hours you work each week at your job."
    why_important: "Hours worked directly relates to earning potential. Full-time workers (40+ hours) typically earn more than part-time workers. Overtime hours (45+) often indicate both higher income and strong work commitment."
    typical_values: "1-99 hours. Standard full-time is 40 hours. Values 40-50 are most common for higher earners."
    model_behavior: "40-50 hours/week increases approval. Below 35 hours (part-time) decreases approval probability."
  
  native_country:
    description: "The country where you were born or originate from."
    why_important: "This captures immigration patterns and their correlation with income in the U.S. census data. Some countries correlate with higher education levels or specific occupation patterns that affect income prediction."
    typical_values: "United-States (most common), followed by Mexico, Philippines, India, China, Canada, and 37 other countries."
    model_behavior: "United-States is the baseline. Some countries with high-skilled immigration patterns may increase approval."

shap_explanation: |
  **What is SHAP?**
  
  SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a method for explaining individual predictions made by machine learning models. 
  Think of it as showing which factors pushed the decision in favor of approval or rejection, and by how much.
  
  **How to Read SHAP Values:**
  
  - **Positive SHAP values** (shown in red/pink): These features pushed the prediction TOWARD ">50K income" (approval)
  - **Negative SHAP values** (shown in blue): These features pushed the prediction TOWARD "≤50K income" (rejection)
  - **Magnitude matters**: A SHAP value of +2.0 has much stronger impact than +0.1
  
  **Understanding Magnitude:**
  
  - **0.0 to 0.5**: Minor influence (small push)
  - **0.5 to 1.5**: Moderate influence (noticeable push)
  - **1.5 to 3.0**: Strong influence (major factor)
  - **3.0+**: Very strong influence (dominant factor)
  
  **Example Interpretation:**
  
  If you see:
  - Age = +1.2: Your age moderately increased the prediction toward higher income
  - Education = +2.5: Your education strongly increased the prediction (major positive factor)
  - Hours_per_week = -0.3: Your work hours slightly decreased the prediction
  - Occupation = +0.8: Your occupation moderately increased the prediction
  
  **Base Value:**
  
  The base value (typically around 0.0 to 0.5) represents the average prediction across all people. 
  The SHAP values show how your specific features moved the prediction away from this average.
  
  **What Makes Features Important:**
  
  Features appear in the explanation because they differ from typical patterns or have strong relationships 
  with income in the model. For example:
  - Having a Master's degree is unusual (only ~5% of population) and strongly predicts higher income
  - Being 45 years old is common but age has strong relationship with income
  - Working 40 hours is common AND standard, so it may not appear if you're typical

model_details: |
  **Model Type**: Random Forest Classifier
  
  **How It Works**:
  A Random Forest is an ensemble of many decision trees (think of it as a committee of experts voting). 
  Each tree looks at different aspects of your information and makes a prediction. The final prediction 
  is the majority vote from all trees.
  
  **Training Data**: 
  - 32,561 records from 1994 U.S. Census
  - 15 features (age, education, occupation, etc.)
  - Balanced for demographic representation
  
  **Performance**:
  - Overall Accuracy: 85.94%
  - Precision (when it predicts >50K, how often is it right?): ~83%
  - Recall (of people who earn >50K, how many does it catch?): ~78%
  
  **What This Means For You**:
  The model is trained to recognize patterns from historical census data. It's good at identifying 
  characteristics associated with higher income (like advanced education, professional occupations, 
  full-time work hours), but it's not perfect. Real-world income depends on many factors the model 
  doesn't see.
  
  **Limitations**:
  - Based on 1994 data (economic conditions have changed)
  - Cannot capture recent career changes or life circumstances
  - Reflects historical income inequality patterns (gender, race pay gaps)
  - Binary classification (>50K or ≤50K) doesn't capture full income range

prediction_explanation: |
  **How Your Prediction Was Made:**
  
  1. **Feature Collection**: The system gathered 13 key pieces of information about you 
     (age, education, occupation, work hours, etc.)
  
  2. **Preprocessing**: Your information was converted into a format the model understands 
     (numbers, categories encoded properly)
  
  3. **Model Inference**: The Random Forest model (trained on 32,561 historical examples) 
     analyzed your profile and compared it to patterns it learned
  
  4. **Probability Calculation**: Based on similar profiles in its training data, the model 
     calculated the probability that someone with your characteristics earns >50K
  
  5. **Decision Threshold**: If probability > 50%, prediction is ">50K". Otherwise, "≤50K"
  
  **Confidence Levels:**
  
  - **50-60%**: Low confidence (borderline case, could go either way)
  - **60-75%**: Moderate confidence (fairly clear patterns)
  - **75-90%**: High confidence (strong patterns matching training data)
  - **90%+**: Very high confidence (profile strongly matches high/low earners)
  
  **Why Probabilities Matter:**
  
  A 51% prediction is very different from a 95% prediction, even though both result in the same 
  classification. Higher probabilities mean the model is more certain based on clearer patterns 
  in the training data.

why_questions:
  why_age: "Age correlates with career experience, professional advancement, and peak earning years. The model learned that income typically increases through your 30s-50s as people advance in careers."
  why_education: "Education level is one of the strongest predictors of income. Higher degrees (Bachelor's, Master's, Doctorate) open access to higher-paying professional roles."
  why_occupation: "Different jobs have vastly different pay scales. Professional and executive roles typically pay much more than service or manual labor positions."
  why_hours: "More hours usually means more income. Full-time workers (40+ hours) earn more than part-time. Overtime indicates both higher pay and job commitment."
  why_marital: "Married couples often have dual incomes or shared expenses, affecting household financial capacity. Marriage status correlates with age and career stability."
  why_workclass: "Employment type indicates income stability. Government and private sector jobs typically offer stable income, while self-employment varies more."
  why_capital_gain: "Investment income indicates wealth beyond salary. Even small capital gains signal financial resources and investment activity."
  why_capital_loss: "While losses reduce income, having investment losses indicates you have assets to invest, suggesting overall higher wealth."
  why_relationship: "Family role correlates with age and financial responsibility. Primary earners (husbands/wives in traditional households) typically have higher incomes than dependents."
  why_country: "Country of origin correlates with immigration patterns, education levels, and occupation types that affect income predictions."
  why_race: "Race reflects historical income inequality patterns in the census data. We include it for transparency but acknowledge it should not be a decision factor."
  why_sex: "Gender reflects the pay gap present in historical data. Like race, we include it for transparency but it should not be used for real decisions."
